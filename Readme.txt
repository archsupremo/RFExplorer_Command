//-----------------Information
//
//This is a simple code example under GCC that works in Ubuntu Linux 11.x
//It may work in other versions as well, but you may need to modify certain
//compiler include settings or define files.
//
//This code will connect with RF Explorer, will reset it (restart) and display version information 
//received after reset. Note: you have to be in Spectrum Analyzer screen mode in RF Explorer for 
//this to work.
//
//If you have problems setting up a compatible development environment, you can
//get a VirtualBox image for free, with all included Codelite IDE, GCC and Ubuntu setup
//ready to compile and work with RF Explorer for development.
//Contact rfexplorer@arocholl.com for more details.
//
//To run this utility example, just type
//
//     ./RFExplorerReset /dev/ttyUSB0
//
//Select a different USB port if needed.
//
//You can easily debug USB and Serial port data transfer by enabling Linux core debug dump
//
//     echo 1 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/generic/module/parameters/debug
//     echo 1 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/cp210x/module/parameters/debug
//
//and then use dmesg to read last activity traced
//
//     dmesg
